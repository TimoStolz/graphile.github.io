/**
 * The Graphile heart has 9 points. Starting at the top middle, we number the
 * points clockwise around the outside A-H, and then M for the middle (which is
 * slightly offset from center):
 *
 *        H    B
 *  G     /'-.-'\     C
 *   \__/    A    \__/
 *    __|     M   |__
 *   /   \       /   \
 *  F      \   /      D
 *           V
 *           E
 *
 * The Graphile heart is defined in a 1200x1200 square, it doesn't quite touch
 * the edges (25 padding on each side).
 *
 * When colouring the heart, we want to avoid there being "gaps" between the
 * colours, so instead of colouring the triangles, we turn them into polygons
 * and cover the next triangle too. Thus the first triangle ABM is actually
 * built as ABCM. From here the segments are numbered in clockwise order - note
 * that every triangle has M as a point in it, and that the last triangle only
 * has the three points.
