title: Requirements
---

PostGraphile is packaged as a Node.js module, you can install it with `npm` or
`yarn` (depending on your preference) - users tend to have fewer issues with
`yarn`, so we recommend it.

We recommend using the latest LTS version of Node.js and PostgreSQL, but we have
limited support for older versions. Using newer released versions should work
fine (we don't recommend using with alpha/beta versions though).

### Your PostgreSQL database

These aren't exactly "requirements", but they will impact your PostGraphile
experience.

- **Use primary keys**: if you don't have primary keys on your tables then they
  won't get the `nodeId` globally unique identifier interface. Further if you
  don't have unique constraints then you won't be able to use the automatic
  update/delete mutations.
- **Use foreign keys**: we infer relations between tables using
  [foreign key constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-FK);
  if you don't use these constraints then we won't know there's a relationship
  between the tables. There are plugins to get around this (using smart
  comments) but it's highly recommended that you use PostgreSQL's built in
  relations support.
- <a name="dont-use-column-based-select-grants"></a> **Don't use column-based
  SELECT grants**: column-based grants work well for `INSERT` and `UPDATE`
  (especially when combined with `--no-ignore-rbac`!), but they don't make sense
  for `DELETE` and they cause issues when used with `SELECT`. Quite a few things
  in PostGraphile depend on full-table `SELECT` grants; if you don't want to use
  full-table grants then you will need to disable the default mutations and use
  custom mutations instead (because we use `RETURNING *` on the mutations), you
  may also have to miss out on computed columns (because we pass the entire row
  object to the function, though these typically still work if you're using
  `LANGUAGE sql` rather than `LANGUAGE plpgsql`/etc). It's recommended that you
  instead split your tables on permission boundaries and use one-to-one
  relations to join them together again - this also makes writing your RBAC/RLS
  policies simpler. If you want to omit a column entirely then you can use the
  [`@omit` smart comment](/postgraphile/smart-comments/#omitting).
- **Function restrictions**: we have pretty good support for PostgreSQL
  functions, but there's some
  [common function restrictions](/postgraphile/function-restrictions/) you
  should check out.
- **Use unique constraints** rather than unique indexes when appropriate: we use
  unique constraints to create mutations such as `updateUserByUsername`; note
  that "PostgreSQL automatically creates a unique index when a unique constraint
  or primary key is defined for a table." --
  [PG docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/indexes-unique.html)
- **Use the defaults** for formatting output; for example we only support the
  default `intervalstyle = 'postgres'` rather than `intervalstyle = 'iso_8601'`.
  Many times this can be solved by returning the relevant default setting value
  from the
  [pgSettings function](/postgraphile/usage-library/#pgsettings-function).
- **Use UTF8 encoding**: GraphQL operates over the UTF8 character set, using
  different encodings may impact your ability to store/retrieve certain values.

On top of this standard PostgreSQL best practices apply: use indexes carefully
for performance, use constraints to ensure your data is valid and consistent,
use triggers to take an action when something happens, etc.

### Node.js: use the LTS

From PostGraphile v4 onwards, PostGraphile requires Node.js version 8.6+ which
provides native support for `async`/`await` and supports many of the ES2017 and
ES2018 features.

### PostgreSQL: use latest

For best results we recommend you use the latest stable release of PostgreSQL
that we officially support (v14 at time of writing), however it should run well
on 9.6 or higher and anything that breaks v9.6 support will be deemed a breaking
change. The absolute earliest version it will run well against is v9.4, however
we do not support this version officially - we strongly recommend you upgrade.

#### PG 9.4 [not officially supported, but works]

Basic operation including introspection.

#### PG 9.5 [not officially supported, but works]

Introduces Row-Level Security - important for securing your schema.

#### PG 9.6 [officially supported]

Introduces the `missing_ok` parameter to the `current_setting(name, missing_ok)`
function - without this you'll need to ensure all `current_setting(name)` calls
reference settings that always exist (e.g. you may need to set them on the
database itself).

`--watch` is also only officially supported on 9.6+ (although it might work on
9.5?)

#### PG 10 [officially supported]

PostgreSQL 10 solves a number of performance issues - the most interesting of
which for us is a significant performance boost to Row Level Security policies!

Introduces
["identity columns"](https://blog.2ndquadrant.com/postgresql-10-identity-columns/)
which we have preliminary support for.

#### PG 11 [officially supported]

Works well.

#### PG 12 [officially supported]

Works well.

#### PG 13 [officially supported]

Works well.

#### PG 14 [officially supported]

Works well.


### Operating system

PostGraphile is developed on Mac OS X and tested on GNU/Linux. It works on
Windows and we would like to officially support Windows but no-one in the core
team uses Windows so we need your help for this. Please get in touch if this is
something you'd like to help with.
