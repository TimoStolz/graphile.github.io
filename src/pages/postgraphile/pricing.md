##### <sup>‡</sup> These features integrate deeply with PostGraphile and have been optimised for its nuances by the maintainer. If you wish to build and maintain protections yourself rather than using the Pro plugin, refer to [Running in Production](/postgraphile/production/) for information on how you might go about doing this. Purchasing the Pro plugin helps fund ongoing development and maintenance on the open source PostGraphile project.

### PostGraphile core is OSS under the MIT license

PostGraphile core is sufficient for many peoples needs; it's the only version
that existed for the first 2 years of the project and many people are running it
with great success in production. No features in PostGraphile core have been
removed or obscured, and it continues to be advanced and enhanced.

Development and maintenance of PostGraphile core is ongoing, supported by
contributions from the community, [professional services](/support/) contracts,
[GitHub Sponsors](/sponsor/) and sales of commercial plugin licenses.

### PostGraphile Pro is a commercial plugin

The Pro plugin enhances PostGraphile with additional features and is loaded
through the standard [server plugin interface](/postgraphile/plugins/).

The Pro plugin contains features that are particularly useful to businesses
wishing to scale their solution out using database read-replicas or protect the
generated GraphQL API from expensive queries which may be issued by untrusted
third parties. (Typically if the intended clients to your GraphQL API are
first-party only then you would use a GraphQL query whitelist (e.g. persisted
queries) for this purpose; although the Pro features can still be helpful to
dissuade your developers from building expensive queries!)

### Does the license cover my production cluster?

The [Pro plugin EULA](https://store.graphile.com/eulas/postgraphile-pro/) states
you may:

> use up to four Production Instances and up to 100 Development Instances of the
> Software

This is enough to cover a small cluster of 4 PostGraphile servers. If you will
be running a larger cluster than this, please
[get in touch](mailto:team@graphile.org?subject=Large%20cluster) for custom
licensing.

### How many licenses do I need to cover my multiple development/testing stages?

The [Pro plugin EULA](https://store.graphile.com/eulas/postgraphile-pro/) states
you may:

> use up to four Production Instances and up to 100 Development Instances of the
> Software

"Development Instance" is defined as "an Instance that is used to support
development, testing or deployment of a Production Instance", which covers
standard development, staging, QA and similar environments.

If you have larger needs than this, please
[get in touch](mailto:team@graphile.org?subject=Large%20cluster) for custom
licensing.

### Where are the @graphile/pro docs/changelog?

You can read the
[@graphile/pro README on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@graphile/pro).
There's also a lot more information in the
[Production Considerations](/postgraphile/production/) page on this website.

### Is the fulfillment of the license key automated?

Yes, license keys are issued automatically by our store software upon completion
of the payment process.

### Do license keys "phone home"?

No, license keys are static and contain all the necessary claims, not dissimilar
to JWTs. Our software does not "phone home."

You are not permitted to use the software once the EULA terminates (e.g. if you
stop paying). We trust you, and want to minimise your maintenance burden, so the
automated keys expire after one year rather than one month. You will be able to
issue new keys via the store when your key is near to expiry. Please do not
abuse our trust.

### Does the Pro License come with direct support?

No. We run community support through our
[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/graphile) where anyone can ask and answer
questions about PostGraphile and the Graphile suite of tools. We offer a
Development Support contract which includes async text support within your own
Slack/GitHub organisation. Prices start at \$1,500 a month, with no minimum
term. More information can be found at the
[Development Support page](/support/).

### I'm an enterprise user and need X, Y and Z

Please [get in touch](mailto:team@graphile.org?subject=Enterprise%20enquiry) and
we'll be happy to help!

### Commercial plugins help fund development on PostGraphile

Maintaining an OSS project is very (very!) time-intensive. Giving this
maintenance work a solid commercial backing benefits hobbyist and commercial
users alike by making the project more sustainable and helping new features and
fixes to be developed and released faster.
