## Migrate 0.1 - no longer highly experimental!

_2020-03-17_

I'm super excited to announce that graphile-migrate@0.1.0 (aka
graphile-migrate@next) is out in pre-release! That's right - we're no longer in
0.0.x territory! This release has a lot of work in it, so it's quite a
significant bump from the previous release. Make sure you familiarise yourself
with the release notes https://github.com/graphile/migrate/releases/tag/v0.1.0
particularly the breaking changes, and have a read of the fully updated README.
Thanks to everyone who filed issues and PRs against Graphile Migrate and of
course to our sponsors who made this significant undertaking possible! ❤️
Believe it or not, Graphile Migrate now has zero open issues and zero pull
requests! (I don't expect this to last long...)

## Worker 0.5

_2020-03-04_

graphile-worker v0.5.0 is released! New Administrative functions, ability to
rename the graphile_worker schema, ability to disable our built-in signal
handling, and a few other improvements. Significant codebase overhaul (but
breaking changes kept to a minimum).

## Graphile Worker 0.4

_2020-02-05_

Performance improvements and ability to efficiently queue jobs from JS.

BREAKING CHANGES:

    TypeScript:
        the ID of a job is a string (database bigint), we previously incorrectly stated it was a number.
        Helpers was renamed to JobHelpers
        TaskOptions was renamed to TaskSpec
    queue_name is now nullable (leave it null for maximum parallel performance)
    when a job is modified using a job_key, the queue_name attribute is now reset like the other attributes

WARNINGS:

    The database schema has changed; your code should not depend on the database schema, only on the public interfaces (add_job, remove_job, etc), so this shouldn't be an issue.

New features:

    Significantly enhanced performance
        Changes database schema such that a job_queue record is only added/checked when necessary
        Uses prepared statements
        Can override the PostgreSQL pool size on the CLI (via --max-pool-size)
    Dedicated API for queueing jobs from JavaScript/TypeScript (makeWorkerUtils / quickAddJob; @mrmurphy, @benjie #60)
    --once now respects --jobs, so it can run jobs in parallel
    jobKey is now available via TypeScript API (@tim-field, #78)

Other:

    Overhauled the perfTest script
    Upgraded dependencies

## GraphQL Finland

_2018-10-23_

Benjie travelled to [GraphQL Finland](https://graphql-finland.fi/2018/) to give
a talk on Database-Driven GraphQL Development. Learn how a database-centric
approach to GraphQL API development can give your engineers more time to focus
on the important parts of your application. Topics covered included
authorization, adhering to GraphQL best practices, embracing the power of
PostgreSQL, and avoiding common pitfalls.
