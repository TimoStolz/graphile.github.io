## GitHub Sponsors now available to companies

_2020-12-08_

GitHub Sponsors is now available to companies. Many companies depend on open
source every day, so it's crucial to invest back into that infrastructure which
they have built their businesses upon. So starting today, companies can sponsor
projects and developers through their existing billing with GitHub.

Sponsoring Graphile to pursue improvements that benefit all parties in the
ecosystem, ensures the software remains relevant and something you'll be able to
rely on for years to come.

## Migrate 0.1 - no longer highly experimental!

_2020-03-17_

I'm super excited to announce that graphile-migrate@0.1.0 (aka
graphile-migrate@next) is out in pre-release! That's right - we're no longer in
0.0.x territory! This release has a lot of work in it, so it's quite a
significant bump from the previous release. Make sure you familiarise yourself
with the release notes https://github.com/graphile/migrate/releases/tag/v0.1.0
particularly the breaking changes, and have a read of the fully updated README.
Thanks to everyone who filed issues and PRs against Graphile Migrate and of
course to our sponsors who made this significant undertaking possible! ❤️
Believe it or not, Graphile Migrate now has zero open issues and zero pull
requests! (I don't expect this to last long...)

## Worker 0.5

_2020-03-04_

graphile-worker v0.5.0 is released! New Administrative functions, ability to
rename the graphile_worker schema, ability to disable our built-in signal
handling, and a few other improvements. Significant codebase overhaul (but
breaking changes kept to a minimum).

## Graphile Worker 0.4

_2020-02-05_

Performance improvements and ability to efficiently queue jobs from JS.

BREAKING CHANGES:

    TypeScript:
        the ID of a job is a string (database bigint), we previously incorrectly stated it was a number.
        Helpers was renamed to JobHelpers
        TaskOptions was renamed to TaskSpec
    queue_name is now nullable (leave it null for maximum parallel performance)
    when a job is modified using a job_key, the queue_name attribute is now reset like the other attributes

WARNINGS:

    The database schema has changed; your code should not depend on the database schema, only on the public interfaces (add_job, remove_job, etc), so this shouldn't be an issue.

New features:

    Significantly enhanced performance
        Changes database schema such that a job_queue record is only added/checked when necessary
        Uses prepared statements
        Can override the PostgreSQL pool size on the CLI (via --max-pool-size)
    Dedicated API for queueing jobs from JavaScript/TypeScript (makeWorkerUtils / quickAddJob; @mrmurphy, @benjie #60)
    --once now respects --jobs, so it can run jobs in parallel
    jobKey is now available via TypeScript API (@tim-field, #78)

Other:

    Overhauled the perfTest script
    Upgraded dependencies

## Graphile goes to FOSDEM

_2020-02-01_

Benjie and Jem are excited to be representing the Graphile suite of tools at
this years FOSDEM in Brussels. FOSDEM is Europe's largest community conference
focussed on Open Source software, providing software developers and communities
a place to meet, get in touch with other developers, find out about the latest
developments in the free software world and attend talks and presentations on
various topics from project leaders. The team had an amazing experience at
FOSDEM in 2019 and are looking forward to meeting thousands of members of the
open source community again. [Send us a message](https://discord.org/graphile)
if you are going so we can arrange to meet!

## Reactive Conf

_2019-11-04_

Benjie and Jem travelled to Prague for
[Reactive Conf](https://reactiveconf.com/) where Benjie gave the keynote on
increasing velocity with GraphQL and Postgres. The talk focused on how the two
tools can pair beautifully, leading to massively increased software development
and delivery speed, faster APIs, fewer bugs and ultimately enabling a greater
focus on delivering value on the frontend rather than maintaining three
different layers of data models and associated logic on the backend.

## GraphQL Finland

_2018-10-23_

Benjie travelled to [GraphQL Finland](https://graphql-finland.fi/2018/) to give
a talk on Database-Driven GraphQL Development. Learn how a database-centric
approach to GraphQL API development can give your engineers more time to focus
on the important parts of your application. Topics covered included
authorization, adhering to GraphQL best practices, embracing the power of
PostgreSQL, and avoiding common pitfalls.
